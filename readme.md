This is a little helper library for ASP.NET MVC to help drive Single Page Applications using my process. I will post more documentation sometime soon and the entire architecture is explained and demonstrated in my new book High Performance Single Page Web Applications http://amzn.to/1b0twcm.

The library has been added to NuGet, https://www.nuget.org/packages/SPAHelper.dll/. It can be installed from the Package Manager Console "PM> Install-Package SPAHelper.dll".
